# RC_Car_with_a_Laser_pointer

### **RC Car with 360째 Laser Pointer - Overview**

1. **Project Summary**:
   - A remote-controlled car with a laser pointer that rotates 360째 horizontally and 180째 vertically using Arduino and Bluetooth control.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **ESP32/Arduino Microcontroller**: Handles Bluetooth communication and controls the car's movement.
   - **Motors & Motor Driver**: Two DC motors controlled by an H-Bridge for forward, backward, left, and right movement.
   - **Laser Pointer**: Mounted on a pan-tilt mechanism controlled by servos for precise aiming.
   - **Servo Motors**: Two servos control the laser's horizontal and vertical movement.
   - **Bluetooth Communication**: Wireless control via a Bluetooth-enabled device (e.g., smartphone).
   - **Power Source**: Rechargeable battery powering the motors, servos, and microcontroller.

3. **Functionality**:
   - **Movement Control**: Forward, backward, left, and right movements are controlled remotely.
   - **Laser Control**: Pan-tilt mechanism allows 360째 laser rotation and vertical adjustments.
   - **Modes**: Operate the car normally or focus on laser control while stationary.

4. **Applications**:
   - **Interactive Play**: Remote control games using the laser pointer.
   - **Targeting Systems**: Precision laser targeting for robotic systems.
   - **Surveillance**: Basic tracking or marking of objects of interest.
   - **Learning**: Ideal for hobbyists to learn Arduino, Bluetooth, motor control, and servos.
